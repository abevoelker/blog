title: "Adding book reviews to the site"

I'm adding a new section to my website: [reviews of books I've read](/book-reviews).

It's something I saw on [a different blog](https://sirupsen.com/books/) that I thought was ingenious, so I'm copying the idea. üïµÔ∏è

I'm hoping it will help me to read more, and better retain what I read. Or at the very least keep a record of what I thought of a book that I can refer to later. If it turns into more chore than beneficial I may stop doing it.

I used to have a Goodreads account but I never kept it up to date, and now given its parent company [Amazon's move to close it off as a walled garden](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25405737) I no longer wish to contribute my data there anyway.

I did make the extra effort to mark up my reviews in [schema.org Review](https://schema.org/Review) syntax, but god knows if search crawlers will really care that much about them. The manual effort reminded me of how poor a user experience it is to handcraft Semantic Web data. Just for the hell of it I glanced at where the [SOLID project is at](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/) and it looks like it's still pretty opaque.

Also, it's worth mentioning given the date that this isn't a New Year's resolution (which I don't do) - I had started working on this a couple months ago but it took me some time to figure out how to make the site generator and theme happy.
