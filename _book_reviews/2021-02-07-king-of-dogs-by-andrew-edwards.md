Pretty enjoyable read. The scenes full of action were well written, and the author is clearly knowledgable about weapons and some survivalcraft. The Soviet-style collapse the book portends is seeming pretty plausible right about now too.

However, the book can get up its own ass a bit too much with some of the philosophizing. I guess to make the protagonist into a sort of warrior poet? Those bits weren't all bad but sometimes it sounded like the author consulted a thesaurus to pull out some ten dollar words.

The book would probably make a pretty decent Netflix movie, and I'd read another book of this sort by the author.
